The first task uses the function _puts_recursion to prints a string which is followed by a new line

The second task which invo;ves the use of void _print_rev_recursion(char *s) mainly involves the use of the function _print_rev_recursion which reverses the string defined in the s

The third task aims to find the length of a given string using the function int _strlen_recursion(char *s) and the return should be the length of the string

The fourth task uses the function int factorial(int n) which lists the factorials for any non-negative number and returns a -1 to show an error incase it encounters a negative number
