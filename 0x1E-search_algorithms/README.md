This task involves the searching algorithms and how to go about the learning and understanding the various searching algorithms that are present. As still C is our language of focus, the codes or programs will aim to achieve maximum optimacy but reducung the use of resources that is in terms of time, storage.
<br>
The prototypes of all the functions used will be stored in the search_algos.h file.<br>
